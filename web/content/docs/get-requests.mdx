# GET Requests

## Basic GET Request

```bash
tabby get https://api.example.com/users
```

## With Headers

Add custom headers using the `-H` flag:

```bash
tabby get https://api.example.com/users -H "Authorization: Bearer token123"
```

## Multiple Headers

```bash
tabby get https://api.example.com/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## Query Parameters

You can include query parameters directly in the URL:

```bash
tabby get "https://api.example.com/users?page=1&limit=10"
```

## With Loop Mode

Run the same request multiple times:

```bash
tabby get https://api.example.com/users -l 10
```

This will make 10 GET requests to the endpoint.
