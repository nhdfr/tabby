# Playground


The Tabby Playground lets you generate complex POST commands right from your browser.

- Build and preview POST requests with dynamic templates
- Experiment with placeholders and payloads
- Copy the generated command to run with your local Tabby install

> **Note:** The playground does not execute requests itself. You’ll need to have Tabby installed locally to run the generated commands.

Perfect for demos, quick tests, and sharing command examples.
