# Welcome to Tabby

Tabby is a powerful terminal-based HTTP testing tool with automated data generation, loop mode for stress testing, and template support. Think of it as curl, but better.

## Features

- **Template Placeholders** - Use `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{uuid}}` and more for dynamic data
- **Loop Mode** - Run requests multiple times for stress testing
- **JSON Support** - First-class JSON body support with template files
- **Simple CLI** - Intuitive command-line interface
