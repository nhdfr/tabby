# Welcome to Tabby

Tabby is a powerful terminal-based HTTP testing tool with automated data generation, loop mode for stress testing, and template support. Think of it as curl, but better.

## Features

- **Template Placeholders** - Use `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{uuid}}` and more for dynamic data
- **Loop Mode** - Run requests multiple times for stress testing
- **JSON Support** - First-class JSON body support with template files
- **Simple CLI** - Intuitive command-line interface

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/nhdfr/tabby@latest
```

### Basic Usage

Make a simple GET request:

```bash
tabby get https://api.example.com/users
```

Make a POST request with JSON body:

```bash
tabby post https://api.example.com/users -b '{"name": "{{name}}", "email": "{{email}}"}'
```
