# Loop Mode

Loop mode allows you to run the same request multiple times, perfect for stress testing APIs or generating bulk data.

## Basic Usage

Run a request 10 times:

```bash
tabby get https://api.example.com/health -l 10
```

## With Dynamic Data

Each iteration generates new placeholder values:

```bash
tabby post https://api.example.com/users -b '{"name": "{{name}}"}' -l 100
```

This creates 100 different users, each with a unique name.

## Stress Testing

Test API performance under load:

```bash
tabby get https://api.example.com/users -l 1000
```

## Output Summary

After loop mode completes, Tabby shows:

- Total requests made
- Successful responses
- Failed responses
- Average response time
- Min/Max response times

## Best Practices

1. **Start small** - Begin with `-l 10` to verify everything works
2. **Monitor the API** - Check server logs during stress tests
3. **Use rate limiting** - Some APIs may throttle or block rapid requests
4. **Template variety** - Use placeholders to generate realistic varied data
